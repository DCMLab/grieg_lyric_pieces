============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 1, '1/8', 'C.V{') ms3.Parse.grieg_lyric_pieces.op57n05
	The label 'C.V{' in m. 1, onset 1/8 (MC 1, onset 1/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of C.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('5', '7', '2') [('G', 'B', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.8 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
